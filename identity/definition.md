Why | Pain Reason
-----------------

### Problem

+ People know they need to have the best way to manage their knowledge or memory
+ People want to help enhance or extend their knowledge or memory of their need
+ People should have that best tool or system then make their life better

+ There should be the simplest, easiest, fastest, and most effective way to manage knowledge whereever
+ Existing tools should not be slow, heavy, bloated, ineffective, vendor locked-in, and anti cross-platform

+ A need for a single system that can adapts into various kinds of purpose in terms of managing and collecting knowledge, information, or data
+ A need for a full-fledged natural system rather than just digital software application

+ Because managing knowledge with bookmarks, notes, todo lists, wiki, and visual dependent approach are often messy and very limited in storing various type of data
+ Because too many different softwares are separated to do just their own solution for different problems, while actually have the same basic underlying principle in managing data, information, or knowledge

+ Most knowledge information that we know are scattered across different documents, applications, and systems
+ Most people don't know how and where to start reading information or gathering knowledge for specific task, project, or development
+ Most way of sending message like chat and email are for conversational but not for exchanging knowledge
+ Most tools are complicated or limited, also only lives in one system
+ Most text notes are not accurate, less precise, or not informative enough
+ Most systems remain just when online only and stuck within proprietary system
+ Most services are too specific, leading to more apps needed to do something that is related but outside the functionality
+ Most user experience in current available software are bad
+ Most contribution flow in Wiki is too ridiculously confusing and disorganized to understand for most people, make it hard to actually or have desire to contribute
