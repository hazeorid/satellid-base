### Problem

- People know they need to have the best way to manage their knowledge or memory.
- People want to help enhance or extend their knowledge or memory of their need.

- There should be the simplest, easiest, fastest, and most effective way to manage knowledge whereever.
- People should have that best tool or system then make their life better.
- Existing tools mostly slow, heavy, bloated, ineffective, vendor locked-in, and not cross-platform.

- Single system that can adapts into various kinds of purpose in terms of managing and collecting knowledge, information, or data.
- A need for a full-fledged natural system rather than just digital software application.

- Managing knowledge with bookmarks, notes, and todo lists approach are often messy and very limited in storing various type of data.
- Too many different softwares are separated to do just their own solution for different problems, while actually have the same basic underlying principle in managing data, information, or knowledge.

- Most knowledge information that we know are scattered across different documents, applications, and systems.
- Most people don't know where to start reading information or gathering knowledge for specific task, project, or development.
- Most tools are complicated or limited, also only lives in one system.

- Most contribution flow in Wiki is too ridiculously confusing and disorganized to understand for most people, make it hard to actually or have desire to contribute.
- Most user experience in current available software are bad.
